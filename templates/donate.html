                Jasmin's World Cup blog is not sponsored by anyone and is therefore dependent on donations from readers.
                Currently Jasmin is a student and is not able to pay for the blog himself.
                In order to keep the blog running, Jasmin needs to pay for the hosting and the domain name.
                If you would like to see Jasmin travel to the next World Cup a considerable amount of money is needed. If you would like to help Jasmin
                please find the link below. Any amount is appreciated. Thank you for your support!
