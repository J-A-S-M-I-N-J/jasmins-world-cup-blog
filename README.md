# Jasmin's World Cup Blog

- **Jasmin's World Cup Blog** is a place where you can find out about the latest news and updates regarding the World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Jasmin follows every game and every goal and will be posting relevant content during the duration of the Cup (and perhaps the next World Cup). The blog provides deep insight on the teams and and the players and gives predictions for the tournament. Jasmin/the creator of the site is a huge football fan and has been following the World Cup since 1998. He has been to the World Cup in 2010 and 2014 and is a big fan of Croatia, which is part of his family heritage. He is also a big fan of the Italian Serie A and follows the teams in the league closely.

- The goal of the blog is to share football knowledge surrounding the teams and help people predict results. The posts cover previous matchups, predicted line-ups and some story-telling around the squads. 
- The purpose is also to collect donations to fund trips to upcoming World Cups through it's donation-page.
- The site has an about page so that you can find out more fun-facts about the host and get to know him. 
- The site has 6 posts per page ranked from latest-to-oldest directly on the landing page. 
- The page is also looking for guest-writers to provide extra content, however these posts need to be approved by admin.

The bookmark and ability to like will only be displayed if you are logged in. 

### About

- The About page is a simple static page with some text about Jasmin (creator of the page)

### Donate

- Donate-page is a page where I explain that the page needs funding in order to be able to run, and where Jasmin is trying to crowd-fund to be able to go to the World Cup. The donation-link is a paypal-image that leads right to the 'send-money' page on Paypal. 

### Login/Logout

- The link in the navbar leads you to a page where you can create an account and login. This is needed to be able to write guest-posts and like/bookmark items. When you're logged in, the navbart-link shows 'logout' and vice versa. 

### Footer

- Footer is simple with a text explaining where to go to follow me on socials.
